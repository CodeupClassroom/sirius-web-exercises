What draws you to coding and web development as a career?

What are your greatest strengths? Weaknesses?

How has your background helped prepare you for web development (technical and non-technical)?

Describe your dream job in web development.

What technologies interest you, web development/coding-related, and otherwise?

What online resources do you use to to get the latest info/news on technology?

































================================= PRO-TIPS

"Be excellent to each other. Party on, dudes!"

Conduct yourself with professionalism (consider that THIS IS YOUR JOB).

What is professional behavior? It means even on difficult days, doing the following:
  - communicate effectively
  - allow others to "save face", especially in conflict
  - escalate issues upward
  - follow through with commitments
  - knowing your limits (when to take a break, when to disengage, when to escalate)

Be heard (don't fail silently).

Have a growth mindset

Pro Tips: 

- Always be eager to fail and make mistakes
- Study outside of class
- Read ahead in the curriculum
- Wash your dishes
- Attend meetups
- Help each other and form study groups
- Don't treat lectures like YouTube (be engaged)

================================= TERMINAL

-- Intro --

Everything in your file system is either a file or a folder/directory (a container for files)

The Mac file system is organized in a tree-like structure:


                        Home directory navigate to this level using cd ~
                        (caseyedwards)

                        |           |
                        |           |

               Applications/       Desktop/   Etc...

            |               |          |
            |               |          |

    Calculator.app       Calendar/     somefile.txt



Absolute vs. Relative file paths


From the desktop directory to get to oberon-web-exercises...

Absolute: cd ~/IdeaProjects/oberon-web-exercises

Relative: 
  cd ..
  cd IdeaProjects
  cd oberon-web-exercises

  OR

  cd ../IdeaProjects/oberon-web-exercises
