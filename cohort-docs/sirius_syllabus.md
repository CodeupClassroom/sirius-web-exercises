## Curriculum

All students will be given access to Codeup's curriculum, located at
[http://java.codeup.com](http://java.codeup.com).

Students are encouraged to do their own research and utilize external resources as
well.

## Grades

Your grade is made of the following components:

| Item                | Percentage | Description                                                     |
|---------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Quizzes             |        20% | Cumulative average of every multiple choice quiz                |
| Exercise Completion |        20% | Cumulative percentage of curriculum exercises completed         |
| Assessments         |        40% | Average performance on assessments (timed coding challenges)    |
| Attendance          |        20% | Attendance percentage                                           |

- Academic Progress is measured in 5 periods of ~4 weeks. 
    - Reports will be delivered within a week of period completion
- Multiple-choice quizzes will be taken towards the end of every module
- We will conduct periodic skills-based assessments in order to demonstrate programming comprehension.
- Exercise completion will be determined based on the work on your GitHub account
    - Files **must** be properly-named and in the correct directory location
    - Exercises are graded as complete/incomplete based on visual inspection 
      and demonstration of functionality.
    - Exercise grades per grading period are cumulative. That is, each average includes all exercises which are expected to be completed through that point in the course.

## Being a Decent Human

Please be respectful and professional in your interactions with Codeup staff, your peers, and potential employers.

**Do**

- Work tenaciously!
- Lift all higher
- Be Vulnerable
  - It's okay to admit what you don't know and ask for help.
- Ask questions
  - Leave space for everyone to share their own curiosity
  - Vocally, in Zoom chat, or Slack -> All are welcome!
- Collaborate with and help your peers
  - Sometimes we learn best from each other!
- Be curious and seek out new challenges
  - Finished with your work and want more? Ask!
  - Want to pick up that project you found online? Do it!
- Take breaks when you need them
  - Use your good judgement and be ready to catch up!
- Make sure to mute!
  - Don't be the reason someone is distracted from a lesson and misses something important.
  
**Avoid**

- Being unkind. 
  - The better we treat each other, the more we all learn.
- Cliques
  - Our unconscious biases sometimes leave brilliance behind.
- Projecting frustration onto others
  - When things get tough, take a second. Take a breath and reach out. We're all in this together.
- Not muting
  - I mean... really, we can hear you.

If you need to take care of personal business, just give us a heads up - but be mindful of content you may miss.

### Most importantly... be kind to yourself.

## Attendance

Class starts at 9:00 every morning. This doesn't mean you should show up at 9,
rather, you should be ready to begin at 9, meaning you should be present at
least 10 to 15 minutes prior in order to review the past day's material and
prepare for the current day.

- Arriving later than 9:00 counts as a tardy
- Arriving later than 9:15 counts as a half day absence
- Leaving before 4:45 counts as a half day absence
- Leaving before 5 counts as an early departure

Please do come to class early if you want to hang out, ask questions, 
or listen to our questionable taste in music.

***If you are not going to be present for any reason, email [sirius-staff@codeup.com](sirius-staff@codeup.com)
to let us know.***

#### Classroom Hours:

- All times are in Central Standard/Daylight
- Generally 9 to 5
- End early on Tuesdays (4pm)
- Half-day on Wednesdays
- Long lunch or lunchtime speakers on Thursdays

|     | Start | Lunch        | Stop |
|-----|-------|------------  |------|
| Mon | 9:00  | 12:30 - 1:30 | 5:00 |
| Tue | 9:00  | 12:30 - 1:30 | **4:00** |
| Wed | 9:00  |    [EOD]    | **12:30** |
| Thu | 9:00  | **12:00** - 1:30 | 5:00 |
| Fri | 9:00  | 12:30 - 1:30 | 5:00 |

In addition, we will often hold "Office Hours" after class to provide additional assistance or just decompress!

## How to Get Help

The best and fastest way to get help from the first available staff member 
is by posting to our cohort's question channel (#sirius-queries) in Slack.

Outside of classroom hours, email [sirius-staff@codeup.com](sirius-staff@codeup.com) 
or send a Slack message to the #sirius-queries channel for help with your questions. 

When emailing for support, please be sure to include all instructors
in the email through the [sirius-staff@codeup.com](sirius-staff@codeup.com) list, 
as opposed to emailing an individual instructor.

In addition, you may schedule time with a TA or
instructor during study hall hours (before or after class).

***Please refrain from sending personal messages to a staff member with questions about classwork.
You will receive a much more timely response by using Slack***

### Effectively asking for help

#### What *IS* an effective support request?

  - "On step 3 of the [exercise name], I need a little more clarity concerning this statement: '[directions]'."
  - "On step 5 of the Functions exercise, I wrote this: [code snippet] and am receiving this output: [console output snippet]. I have referenced [snippet from curriculum] and attempted a solution from [online resource]. Can someone help point me in the right direction?"

#### What is *NOT* an effective support request?

  - "I got a question."
  - "My code don't work."
  - "I don't know where to start"

If you are more thorough you are in your request, the staff will better be able to help solve the *actual* issue.

## Miscellaneous

### Teamwork / Collaboration

Development is not a solo activity. You will be expected to work collaboratively
with your classmates, both informally throughout the course, and formally, in
the form of pair and group projects.

Please be kind and patient to each other (and yourself). 

Remember: learning something new is challenging for everyone. The way you communicate with to your teammates can be what makes this a fun and succesful experience!

### Presentations / Code Demos

Throughout the course you will be called upon to demo and discuss your work to
the rest of the class. 

- Don't worry about perfection! Working through an issue with the class is a **great** learning experience for you and everyone else.
- This is an opportunity to hone your skills of explain both the use of your applications and eloquently describe how your code accomplishes those uses!
- You may feel anxious before presenting but don't worry. We are here to support and lift each other!
- When someone else is presenting, be an active listener. You want the same respect when you are presenting as well.
- If someone else has a cool design or clever code solution, let them know! It feels good to know your work is noticed and appreciated.
